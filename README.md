5 Things You Need to Know About Getting Porcelain Veneers

Do you feel less than confident about your smile? Do you long for that perfect grin?

If so, an investment in porcelain veneers might be the perfect solution. Enhancing your smile can have a positive impact on all aspects of your life, personally and professionally.

Porcelian Veneersare thin shells of porcelain bonded on top of your natural teeth. This cosmetic procedure has grown in popularity over the years, offering dream smiles to countless patients.

If you’re considering dental veneers for yourself, here are 5 things you should know about this procedure.

1. You Need to Start with Healthy Teeth

Before you can get started with veneers, your teeth must be free from cavities or infections.

You can’t put cosmetic restorations over infected teeth. The gums around your teeth should also be healthy and free from inflammation.

If this means you need to up your oral hygiene habits so you can move forward, now is the time to do so. If you are looking to improve a smile with decayed, broken or worn teeth, porcelain crowns might be a better solution.

2. You Can Choose the Shape and Color

One of the great things about veneers is you can completely customize your new look. You’ll be able to pick from a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and shades.

Your dentist can help you with this process as you try different single veneers to help you find the perfect color and fit. Some patients choose veneers that are extra white and bright, while others go for a more natural, less obvious look.

3. Porcelain Veneers Are Made to Last

Though porcelain veneers won’t last a lifetime, they will last 10 to 15 years on average (with proper care). Just like natural teeth, veneers are still susceptible to damage.

Your dentist will teach you how to care for your new teeth to help them last for many years. It’s up to you, the patient, to increase the lifespan of your new veneers.

4. Veneers Require a Two-Step Process

Most veneers are made out of porcelain handcrafted to fit each patient’s unique mouth.

Your dentist will start by getting an impression of your bite, which is then sent to a lab. You’ll wear temporary veneers for a few weeks before the permanent ones are ready to be put into place.

Even “no-prep” veneers need this separate step before customization can take place.

5. Veneers Are a Long-Term Commitment

Once your veneers are in place, take care to avoid anything that can damage them. Don’t open packages with your teeth, avoid hard candies, and resist biting your nails.

If you ever do need to have your veneers removed for restorative reasons, your original teeth will have been altered. This means that if you take your veneers off, you’ll have to replace them and keep wearing veneers for life.
